In the Argparse mathod I want the user to be able to 
1. input cases followed by a county or Texas, which will return the number of confirmed cases for that county
2. input deaths followed by a county or Texas, which will return the number of deaths for that county
3. input list, which will return a list of counties 
4. input help, which will return a list of the commands the user can imput 
5. create an error message if the user doesn't correctly enter one of the first 4 commands
